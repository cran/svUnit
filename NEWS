= svUnit News

== svUnit 0.7-1

* Upgrade to the Komodo SciViews-K Unit plugin version 0.7-1.


== svUnit 0.7-0

* Typo correction in guiTestReport.Rd.


== svUnit 0.6-3

* The task callback mechanism introduced in svSocket 0.9-48 is now used to all
  running the task after R code send by socket clients is executed.


== svUnit 0.6-2

* There is now a vignette for the svUnit package.


== svUnit 0.6-1

* Correction of a bug in Windows relative to path separators \\ versus /,
  especially usinf tempdir().

* Correction of a bug that prevented to list runit*.R files in the unitTests
  subdirectory of a package under Windows.


== svUnit 0.6-0

* The package does not depends any more from RUnit. It has his own checkXXX()
  function (they are compatible with those in RUnit 0.4.17, except that here the
  checkTrue() function is vectorized, but they operate very differently),

* svUnit functions and objects are renamed svSuite, and there is a reworking of
  objects to end with svTest, svSuite, svTestData and svSuiteData, and many new
  methods for those objects (print, summary, stats, metadata, makeUnit, runTest)

* print.svSuiteData and summary.svSuiteData are completely reworked.

* svSuiteList() now accepts additional, dirs, manages an exclusion list and has
  an argument 'loadPackages' to force loading packages provided in the list.

* Names for test units is now runit<name>.R, like in the RUnit package. Same for
  the test functions which are test<name>.R (used to be runit.<name>.R and
  test.<name.R).

* The temporary directory is now emptied from old runit*.R files before making
  new ones, but not any more after running tests. That way, we avoid running old
  test definitions, while keeping the latest one available for inspection.

* koUnit_xxx() functions have been added to manipulate the R Unit GUI in
  Komodo from within R.


== svUnit 0.5-0

* Added guiTestFeedback() and guiTestReport() functions.

* A couple of other little changes.


== svUnit 0.4-0

First version compiled as a package and distributed on R-Forge.
