= svUnit To Do list

* guiTestFeedback() must be finished.

* Install SciViews-K Unit Komodo extension.

* Output results in htm, wiki, etc. format (summary.svSuiteData).

* Queue tests to run and run them asynchronously using tcltk and after() if
  this package is loaded and we are in interactive() mode.

* RUnit code coverage functions.

* People ask for checkWarning() function... But warnings are not part of code
  execution. Provide an example to show how, by using options(warning = ...) and
  checkException(), one can detect warnings.

* butler: benchmark and profiling => check it.

* Split example test into smaller test functions.

* Make a vignette (and perhaps a demo) for this package.

* Translate this package.

* In RUnit/share/R, there are checkCode.r and compareRUnitTestData.r. The former
  provides functions for test R code in R files, the latter does a comparison of
  timings in two test set runs, using a tolerance value. Worth checking and
  integrating later on!

* In RUnit: one bug is reported on RUnit SourceForge area for RUnit 0.4.17.
  Follow this to make sure it is corrected (or work on a patch!)

	myfun <- function(a, b = 98, c = 99){
		cat("a = ", a, ", b = ", b, ", c = ", c, "\n")
	}
	myfun(1, c = 2)
	# So far so good. Now let's inspect myfun:

	library(RUnit)
	track <- tracker()
	track$init()
	inspect(myfun(1, c = 2), track = track)
	# Here, we see that myfun is calld with argument not matched by names!

* In svUnit checkTrue() is vectorized, but not in RUnit. I made a proposition to
  the RUnit maintainer => look what happens in future versions.
